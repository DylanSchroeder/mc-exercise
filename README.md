### What Marc Learned
- Don't work on the master branch
- It is important to work in a separate branch and to ACP frequently. 
- Use descriptive commit messages so others know what you worked on.
- When finished create a pull request on GitHub for other team members to review your work
- Frequently get everyone's laptop in sync by performing a git pull.
