##Ethan learned
it is best to do a git pull origin master when someone pushes to best avoid merge conflicts all together. Along with that its best to avoid pushing commits to master directly
##John Learned
Make sure that you do a git pull origin master after pushing your commits through to the master brnch so everyone is up to date.
Have everyone work on a different section of the project. Don't start working on the body if you were assigned to work on the footer. 
Make sure everthing is up to date when you start your projects.
