## What Marc Learned
- Don't work on the master branch
- It is important to work in a separate branch and to ACP frequently. 
- Use descriptive commit messages so others know what you worked on.
- When finished create a pull request on GitHub for other team members to review your work
- Frequently get everyone's laptop in sync by performing a git pull.
##Ethan learned
- it is best to do a git pull origin master when someone pushes to best avoid merge conflicts all together. Along with that its best to avoid pushing commits to master directly
##John Learned
- Make sure that you do a git pull origin master after pushing your commits through to the master brnch so everyone is up to date.
- Have everyone work on a different section of the project. Don't start working on the body if you were assigned to work on the footer. 
- Make sure everthing is up to date when you start your projects.
